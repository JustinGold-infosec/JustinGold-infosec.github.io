# About Me

Cybersecurity Professional with a passion for securing the future, and obsession with the intergration of technology in facets everyday life.

## Background
 Cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in SOC operations, incident response, digital forensics, and security program implementation. I bring a non-traditional path into cyber starting in operations and IT infrastructure before moving into a dedicated security role which gives me a practical, operations-first approach to defending environments.

 At Barricade Cyber Solutions, I worked directly in threat monitoring, incident response, and DFIR services while building daily KPI reporting for clients. At JMWSC, I stood up various IT security functions for a water utility — building a security awareness program from scratch, creating real-time OT and IT reporting dashboards in Power BI, and serving as the primary technical point of contact across MSP, OT, and third-party vendor relationships. I've seen firsthand how operational technology environments work, where they're vulnerable, and why bridging the IT/OT security gap matters.
